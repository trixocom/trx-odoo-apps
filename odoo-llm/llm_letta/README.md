# Letta LLM Integration

## Overview

This is a **foundational module** that integrates [Letta](https://www.letta.com/) agents with Odoo. Letta is an advanced AI agent framework with built-in persistent memory, allowing agents to maintain context across conversations.

**What makes Letta different from standard LLM providers?**
- **Persistent Memory**: Letta agents maintain their own conversation history and memory state on the server side
- **Stateful Agents**: Each Odoo thread gets its own dedicated Letta agent that persists across sessions
- **Tool Access**: Agents can access Odoo data through Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> **Note**: This is a foundational integration. Advanced features like viewing tool calls in Odoo, shared memory across threads, and memory block management UI are planned for future releases.

## Features

- **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Automatic creation, updating, and cleanup of Letta agents per thread
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Zero-config connection to Odoo's MCP server
- **Auto-sync Tools**: Thread tools automatically synchronized to Letta agents
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming
- **Flexible Deployment**: Works with both self-hosted Letta server and Letta Cloud
- **Security**: Automatic per-user API key generation for MCP authentication

## Requirements

### Server Requirements

- **Letta Server**: Version 0.11.7+ (earlier versions have MCP bugs)
  - Self-hosted via Docker (recommended)
  - Or Letta Cloud account
- **PostgreSQL**: With `pgvector` extension enabled
- **Odoo Modules**:
  - `llm_letta`: This module
  - `llm_mcp_server`: Required for tool access

### Python Requirements

- **Letta Python Client**: Custom fork required (fixes model fetching bug)
  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/apexive/letta-python.git@main
  ```
  _Note: Forked version needed due to [`listembeddingmodels()` bug](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-python/issues/25) in official client_

### Optional

- **OpenAI API Key**: For using OpenAI models
- **Ollama**: For local open-source models

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Python Client

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/apexive/letta-python.git@main
```

### Step 2: Set Up Letta Server (Docker)

**1. Add to your `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
services:
  letta:
    image: letta/letta:latest
    ports:
      - "8083:8083" # Web UI
      - "8283:8283" # API server
    env_file:
      - .env.letta
```

**2. Create Letta database with vector support:**

```bash
# Replace POSTGRES_USER with your PostgreSQL username
psql -U POSTGRES_USER postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE letta OWNER POSTGRES_USER"
psql -U POSTGRES_USER letta -c "CREATE EXTENSION vector"

# Example (if your postgres user is 'odoo'):
# psql -U odoo postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE letta OWNER odoo"
# psql -U odoo letta -c "CREATE EXTENSION vector"
```

**3. Create `.env.letta` configuration file:**

```bash
cat > .env.letta <<EOF
LETTA_PG_URI=postgresql://POSTGRES_USER:POSTGRES_PASSWORD@host.docker.internal:5432/letta
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434  # Optional: for local models
EOF

# Example (if postgres user is 'odoo' with password 'odoo'):
# LETTA_PG_URI=postgresql://odoo:odoo@host.docker.internal:5432/letta
```

**4. Start Letta server:**

```bash
docker compose up letta -d
```

Server will be available at:
- API: `http://localhost:8283`
- Web UI: Access via https://app.letta.com/settings/organization/projects?view-mode=selfHosted

See [Letta docs](https://docs.letta.com/guides/selfhosting) for more details.

### Step 3: Configure MCP Server in Odoo

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows Letta agents to access Odoo tools.

1. Go to: **LLM → Configuration → MCP Server**
2. Set **External URL**: `http://host.docker.internal:8069`
   - This allows Letta in Docker to access Odoo running on the host machine

### Step 4: Install Odoo Module

```bash
odoo-bin -d your_db -i llm_letta,llm_mcp_server
```

## Quick Start

**Get started in 5 minutes:**

1. Go to **LLM → Threads** → Create new thread
2. Select:
   - **Provider**: "Letta (Local)"
   - **Model**: Any available model
3. Start chatting!

**That's it!** The agent is automatically created with:
- Access to all your active Odoo tools
- Persistent memory across conversations
- Context awareness

## Configuration

### Local Server (Default)

The default "Letta (Local)" provider connects to `localhost:8283` - no API key needed.

This is perfect for:
- Development
- Self-hosted deployments
- Maximum privacy and control

### Letta Cloud

To use Letta Cloud instead of self-hosting:

1. Get API token from [Letta Cloud](https://app.letta.com)
2. In Odoo: Go to **LLM → Providers → "Letta (Cloud)"**
3. Configure:
   - **API Key**: Your Letta Cloud token
   - **Project Name**: Default is "default-project"
4. Use "Fetch Models" wizard to sync available models

## Tool Integration

### Zero-Configuration MCP Setup

Letta agents automatically connect to Odoo's MCP server:

- **API keys generated automatically** per user (no manual setup!)
- All active `llm.tool` records instantly available to agents
- Tools sync automatically when thread configuration changes

### Available Tool Operations

Through MCP integration, agents can:

- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete records
- **Method execution**: Call model methods with parameters
- **Model inspection**: Explore available models and fields

For technical details, see `TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md`.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation

Create a thread with Letta provider and start asking questions:

```
User: What are my pending sales orders?
Agent: [Uses tools to query sale.order model and returns results]
```

### Stateful Context

The agent remembers previous conversations:

```
Session 1:
User: My company focuses on solar energy solutions
Agent: Got it, I'll remember that

Session 2 (days later):
User: Show me relevant product categories
Agent: Based on your focus on solar energy solutions, here are...
```

### Tool Usage

Agents can perform actions:

```
User: Create a new customer named "Acme Corp" with email acme@example.com
Agent: [Uses create_record tool] Created customer with ID 123
```

## Troubleshooting

### Letta server not connecting

Check Docker logs:
```bash
docker logs letta
```

Verify server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8283/v1/health
```

### Tools not available to agent

1. Verify `llm_mcp_server` module is installed
2. Check MCP server configuration in Odoo (LLM → Configuration → MCP Server)
3. Ensure External URL is correctly set to `http://host.docker.internal:8069`
4. Check that tools are active in LLM → Tools

### Agent not remembering context

- Verify PostgreSQL `pgvector` extension is installed in Letta database
- Check Letta server logs for memory-related errors
- Ensure database connection in `.env.letta` is correct

### Streaming not working

- Ensure you're using the forked Letta client (from apexive/letta-python)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Odoo is in development mode for detailed error logs

## Advanced Topics

### How Memory Works

Letta agents maintain their own conversation history and memory state on the Letta server side:

- **One Agent Per Thread**: Each Odoo thread creates a dedicated Letta agent (stored in `external_id`)
- **Server-Side Memory**: Agent memory is stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector extension on the Letta server
- **Only Latest Message Sent**: The integration sends only the latest user message - Letta maintains full conversation context internally
- **Memory Blocks**: Agents are initialized with default persona and human memory blocks

### Agent Lifecycle

- **Creation**: Automatically created when a new Letta thread is started
- **Updates**: Agent model and system prompt updated when thread configuration changes
- **Tool Sync**: Tools automatically synchronized when `tool_ids` changes
- **Cleanup**: Agent and API keys deleted when thread is deleted or provider changes

### MCP Server Architecture

The integration uses Odoo's MCP server to expose tools to Letta agents:

- API keys generated automatically per user for MCP authentication
- MCP server registered with Letta on first tool attachment
- Tools synced bidirectionally (attach new, detach removed)

For detailed technical documentation, see `TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md`.

## Roadmap

Future enhancements planned for this module:

- **Tool Call Visualization**: View tool calls and execution logs in Odoo UI
- **Memory Management UI**: Configure agent memory blocks (persona, human, etc.) from Odoo
- **Shared Memory**: Enable memory sharing across multiple threads
- **Memory Inspector**: Browse and edit agent memory state
- **Advanced Agent Config**: Fine-tune agent parameters (temperature, context window, etc.) from Odoo
