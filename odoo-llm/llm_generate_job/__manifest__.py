LLM Generate Job Management
===========================

This module provides a comprehensive generation job management system for LLM providers.

Features:
- Generation job creation and lifecycle management
- Provider-specific queue management
- Job status tracking and monitoring
- Retry and error handling mechanisms
- Direct vs. queued generation options
- PostgreSQL advisory locking integration

The system supports both direct generation (legacy mode) and queued generation
for better resource management and scalability.

Key Changes:
- Renamed from llm_generation_job to llm_generate_job
- Thread extension now only overrides generate_response() method
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing generate() method
